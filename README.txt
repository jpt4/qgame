Quantum Computing Teaching Game

Project Name: QGame (tentative)

Abstract: A gameplaying framework is proposed for teaching the
mathematical and computational foundations of quantum
computing. Inspired by Bret Victor's "Alligator Eggs" [0] introduction
to the Lambda Calculus, QGame will encode two variants of quantum
computing [1] into rules that are used to build puzzles whose solution
requires learning and reasoning about quantum computing. These puzzles
are then embedded in narrative scenarios to provide a non-specialist
on-ramp to engagement with the quantum computing content underlying
the puzzles, without immediately requiring direct exposure to symbolic
notation and formal systems. QGame will be built in digital and
physical formats, and be playtested and exhibited as part of the
educational outreach of the Bloominglabs makerspace [2], of which the
applicant is a member.

Funding use: Personal expenses, to allow me to dedicate working hours
to QGame, and for building physical prototypes.

Timeline in months: 4

Special Access: No.

Anything else? What else to make project successful?: Four months,
roughly two each for (1) initial development and (2)
playtesting/quality assurance, with the goal of a public demo at
Makevention [0] at the end of August.
